Environment Detection System for Visually Impaired Users

The Environment Detection System for Visually Impaired Users is an AI-powered mobile application designed to enhance situational awareness and independent navigation. Using a smartphone camera, the system detects objects and obstacles in real time and provides immediate audio feedback to the user.

The application processes live video frames on-device to identify relevant objects in the surrounding environment and determines their relative positions. Detected information is communicated through clear, natural speech using a Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine, enabling users to understand their surroundings without relying on visual cues.

By delivering real-time, hands-free audio guidance, the system helps visually impaired users navigate safely, avoid obstacles, and move with greater confidence in everyday environments.
